If the folder to be cleaned is empty, then simple remove the folder.
If the folder contains items, move to the trash directory.
If the folder already exists in the trash directory, then append filename with digits.

Hidden files are ignored for now.

"keep:
Code
Pictures"
This would mean the folders remain as they are.

"clean:
Desktop
Downloads"
This would mean the folders remain, but everything in them is moved to trash.

Folders and files not mentioned are moved to trash. Trash folder is kept even if not mentioned.
